## Welcome to my portfolio!
After participating in the Great Egg Robot Races, School of ELectronic, Electrical and System Engineering, University of Birmingham, where my team built an autonomous line-following robot carrying a chocolate egg, I was fascinated by applying the embedded system in robotics and how the mechanical and electronics design cooperate to achieve the optimization of robots.

In the summer before my undergrad final year, I worked as an electronics intern in Norgren UK Engineering Advantage Center. I developed an embedded web and email server for beverage dispensing system. Besides increasing experience in embedded systems and machine-to-machine communication over the internet (Internet of Things), I really enjoyed working  with mechanical engineers and being exposed to a multidisciplinary environment.
