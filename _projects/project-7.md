## Overview

This is the final project for the course: EECS 395, 495: Applied Mechatronics: Quadrotor Design and Control 

Collabrated on a two-student team, we completed the electrical/mechanical assembly the quadrotor and programmed in C on Raspberry Pi running Linux. The milestones include the reading/writing to IMU over I2C, the complementary filter for raw, pitch and yaw raw data, PWM control using ESCs, PID control of the stable flight with keyboard or joystick.
